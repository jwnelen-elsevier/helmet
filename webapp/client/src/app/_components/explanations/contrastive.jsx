      <p>
        Contrastive explanations are a type of explanation that provide a
        comparison between two instances. The goal of contrastive explanations
        is to provide a comparison between two instances, one of which is the
        instance being explained and the other is a similar instance that would
        have resulted in a different prediction. This comparison can help to
        identify the features that are most important for the model's prediction
        and can provide insights into how the model is making its decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrastive explanations can be useful for understanding how a model is
        making its predictions and can help to identify potential biases or
        errors in the model. By comparing the instance being explained to a
        similar instance that would have resulted in a different prediction,
        contrastive explanations can help to identify the features that are most
        important for the model's prediction and can provide insights into how
        the model is making its decisions.
